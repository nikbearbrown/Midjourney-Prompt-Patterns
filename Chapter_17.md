## **Getting Started**
1. **Access the External Editor**:
   - Open the External Editor through your Midjourney account.
   - Upload your image by selecting **Edit Uploaded Image** or choose an image from your Midjourney gallery.

2. **Prepare Your Workspace**:
   - Uploaded images are private and won’t appear on the public gallery, ensuring privacy and creative freedom.


## **Using the Editing Tools**
### **Edit Tab Features**
1. **Move/Resize**:
   - Reposition or scale your image on the canvas. Any blank space created will be filled with AI-generated details upon submission.

2. **Erase Tool**:
   - Highlight areas to be regenerated. Select extra space around the target area for better results.
   - Example: If adding a logo to a t-shirt, erase the area where the logo should appear.

3. **Restore Tool**:
   - Refine erased areas to ensure precision.

4. **Brush Size**:
   - Adjust the diameter of the erase/restore tool for detailed or broad selections.

5. **Aspect Ratio Selection**:
   - Change the image’s aspect ratio. The AI will expand the original image to fit the new dimensions.

6. **Image Scale**:
   - Use the slider to expand the image canvas and allow the AI to generate additional content.

7. **Suggest Prompt**:
   - Use the Describe tool to generate a prompt based on your image.


### **Retexture Tab**
- **Retexturing** adjusts the surface details of an image, such as lighting and textures, while preserving the overall structure.
- Edit the prompt in the imagine box to align it with your vision.
- Example: Transform a plain t-shirt into a textured design with specific materials like denim or silk.


## **Example Use Case: Adding a Superhero Logo to a T-Shirt**
### **Step-by-Step Process**
1. **Upload the Image**:
   - Select a photo of a t-shirt to be modified.
   
2. **Define the Logo Area**:
   - Use the **Erase Tool** to mark the chest area for the logo.
   - Adjust the **Brush Size** for precision.

3. **Create a Prompt**:
   - Write a descriptive and ethical prompt, such as:
     _“A black t-shirt with a vibrant red and yellow superhero emblem.”_
   - Avoid using specific trademarked names or designs.

4. **Submit Your Edit**:
   - Click **Submit Edit** to process the changes.

5. **Refine and Repeat**:
   - Use the Undo or Reset tools if the result isn’t satisfactory.
